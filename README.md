## Projects

The projects below were created during my time at university.

### Fantasy Rhythm


### Game Graphics

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Akeilee/Akeilee.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
